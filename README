Project by: John Kusner

Building:
	Makefile is included, run
		$ make
	to build the project.

Executing:
	Run
		$ java -jar jjk320kusner.jar
	Note that ojdbc7.jar is required for execution.

Data sources:
	- Names from edgar0 student and instructor tables

	
TODO:
	good universal exception handling
	make prices of products uniform at all warehouses (maybe a trigger or something would help)
	unify customer interfaces, make the difference that online requires login, offline requires you to pick store,
		stock information is dependent on if you are at a store or from the warehouses
	figure out why this wont work:
		Availability for "BBQ Potato Chips":
		- 610 from $5.09/each
		- 682 from $20.71/each
		- 991 from $68.58/each
		- 725 from $69.41/each
		Cheaper items sell first. Your guaranteed price is <= $40.95/each
		Enter desired quantity (0 to cancel)> 10000
		Please enter a value between [0,3008]
		Enter desired quantity (0 to cancel)> 3008
	fix average weighting in price (I think its wrong.)
